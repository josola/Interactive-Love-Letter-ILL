CARD OUTPUT WHEN INSPECTING

SPY
--
0-Spy (x2)

A Spy has no effect when played or discarded.

At the end of the round, if you are the only
player still in the round who played or discarded
a Spy, you gain one favor token.

This does not count as winning the round; the
winner (even if it is you) still gains their token.

Even if you play and/or discard two Spies,
you still gain only one token.
--

GUARD
--
1-Guard (x6)

Choose another player and name a character
other than Guard. If the chosen player has that
card in their hand, they are out of the round.
--

PRIEST
--
2-Priest (x2)

Choose another player and secretly look
at their hand (without revealing it to
anyone else).
--

BARON
--
3-Baron (x2)

Choose another player. You and that player
secretly compare your hands. Whoever has
the lower-value card is out of the round.

If there is a tie, neither player is out
of the round.
--

HANDMAID
--
4-Handmaid (x2)

Until the start of your next turn, other
players cannot choose you for their card effects.

In the rare case that all other players
still in the round are "protected" by a
Handmaid when you play a card, do the following:

- If that card requires you to choose another
player (Guard, Priest, Baron, King), your
card is played with no effect.

- If that card requires you to choose any
player (Prince), then you must chooe
yourself for the effect.
--

PRINCE
--
5-Prince (x2)

Choose any player (including yourself).
That player discards their hand (without
resolving its effect) and draws a new hand.

If the deck is empty, the chosen player draws
the facedown set-aside card.

If a player choose you for the Ptince
effect, and you are forced to discard the
Princess, you are out of the round.
--

CHANCELLOR
--
6-chancellor (x2)

Draw two cards from the deck into your hand.
Choose and keep one of the three cards now
in your hand, and place the other two
facedown on the bottom of the deck in any order.

If there is only one card in the deck, draw it
and return one card. If there are no cards
left, this card is played with no effect.
--

KING
--
7-King (x1)

Choose another player and trade hands with
that player.
--

COUNTESS
--
8-Countess (x1)

The Countess has no effect when played
or discarded.

You must play the Countess as the card for
your turn if either the King or a Prince
is the other card in your hand.

You can still choose to play the Countess
as the card for your turn even if you do
not have the King or a Prince.

When you play the Countess, do not reveal
your other card; the other players will
not know if you were forced to play it
or chose to play it.

The Countess's effect does not apply
when you draw cards for other effects (Chancellor)
--

PRINCESS
--
9-Princess (x1)

If you either play or discard the Princess
for any reason, you are immediately out
of the round.
