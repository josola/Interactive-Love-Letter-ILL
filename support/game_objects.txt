List of objects needed for gameplay:

1. player
2. player hand
3. cards
4. deck
5. up pile
6. discard pile
7. tokens
8. pile of tokens
9. reference card
10. bag to hold game pieces

The player hand, discard pile, down pile, and deck contain cards:
- the deck contains up to 21 cards (its count is lowered as cards are drawn from it) (can have cards removed and then inserted at a determined position)
- the cards in the deck are never held in sequential order, they must be randomly shuffled at the beginning of the game and when instructed to do so.
- the player may shuffle the deck whenever they are requested to do so
- the down pile starts without any cards (can have cards inserted within) (can have cards removed but not inserted after its inital insertion)
- The up pile starts without any cards (can have cards inserted within) (cannot have cards removed after they are inserted)

Each deck needs its game state tracked:
- the deck must keep track of how many cards it has at any time
- the down pile must keep track of how many cards it has at any time
- the up pile must keep track of hor many cards it has at any time
- the deck must know when it is empty (has no cards)

The player can contain tokens, a reference card, and a player hand. The player does not start with tokens or a hand"
- the player hand can hold a maximum of four cards
- the player hand must end a turn with no more, and no less, than two cards (unless the deck is empty and the player cannot draw another card to their hand)

The player can perform multiple actions per game:
- draw a card from either the main deck or the down pile
- discard a card from their hand to the discard pile
- choose a card within their hand to play
- play a card from their hand
- take tokens from the token pile
- put tokens back into the token pile
- read the power of a card
- read the name of a card
- read the description of a card
- target another player
- beome the target of another player
- read their reference card
- determine how many tokens they have
- determine how many tokens their opponents have
- guess how many of a certain card are in an opponents hand
- guess how many of a certain card are in the deck, or the down pile
- determine if an opponent has handmaid protection
- determine who has a spy bonus
- be able to decide between playing one card or another

Each player needs their game state tracked:
- handmaid protection
- spy bonus
- number of tokens
- is playing or not
- is current player
- is agressor
- is target
- is winner
- was winner of previous round
- was the most recent to write a letter
- number of cards in their hand

There are multiple aspects of the overall game state that need to be tracked:
- the number of players must be determined (two player games are different from games with more than two players)
- number of tokens needed to win the game
