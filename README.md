This program is written entirely in the C++ programming language. The developer's intention for this project was to learn how to write clean, easy to read, and reusable object oriented code using C++, while creating a usable product in the process. This intention is currently in development.

Developed using Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and XCode on the Mac, Windows, and Ubuntu (linux) platforms. Here is a link to a short demonstration:
