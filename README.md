# Missive
### A text based card game inspired by the wildly popular card game Love Letter.

Missive is written entirely in the C++ programming language. The developer's intention for this project was to
learn how to write clean, easy to read, and reusable object oriented code using C++, while creating a usable product
in the process. This intention is currently in development.

Development on Missive began purely as a Love Letter clone in text format, this is where branch one comes into play.
Branch one of this repository contains the intial program design and is a 99% working version of the game.
The programming style used in this branch is mostly procedural, leaving the developer with a version of the game that worked, but
was difficult to modify due to its design. When the power of cleanly written, single responsibility object oriented code presented its potential, a rewrite was immediately started in branch two.

Branch two contains the most current version of the Missive game. Written in object oriented style, with clean and easy to read
design paradigms. This branch is currently in development and does not yet represent the finished game, for the finished game you can compile and run branch one.

Developed using Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and XCode on the Mac, Windows, and Ubuntu (linux) platforms. The procedural version
"branch 1" was designed primarly to run on Windows based operating systems, as it has elements that clear the terminal screen between
player turns that work on windows.

All instructions on how to play the game are given to players as they play the game, like a texted based adventure game.

To try this program on your own system, clone this repository using your own methods and security protocols. Then compile and run the program. The program is an executable that launches a local terminal/command prompt session and plays within this session. For branch two "the object oriented rewrite" your include directories should look both in the src folder AND the card folder. **REMINDER:** Branch two is incomplete and does not contain the full game experience that branch one does. Please practice your own security protocols when running software from an untrusted source. This software and all its components are protected under the MIT license.
